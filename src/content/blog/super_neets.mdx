# what is a super neet?

There's a type of person who is quite weird by traditional standards... but
they are also extremely competent and somehow manage to just make incredible
things happen on a regular basis


Depending on your own life experience, you may have varying interpretations of
this "super neet" character:

> "they make money almost by accident"

Everyone has dreamt of a life where they just obsessively pursued the things
that they enjoy and somehow get paid for it.

Most people hold onto this for a while, but eventually toss the fantasy out of
the window as they get older.

# how did they become super neets?

It's not just that super neets want to have fun. Their identity, taste, and
ability have been refined beyond anything you typically see in distribution.

Look past the fun and eccentric personas and you'll find honest people who
still had to figure out the path to becoming extremely well-rounded:

1. strong executive function
2. deep in a skill tree + well-versed across domains
3. highly charismatic

These people just tend to work hard + read a lot (internet, blogs, books, etc.)

# hypothesis - why are super neets like this?

> \> "If they are so competent, go work on something useful"

No one reaches this point by pursuing useless activities or trying to be
particularly "weird". You're observing people who are just trying to fully
express their agency.

> "neet" is end game.

They have virtually infinite resources and are just roaming around making up
side quests for other players. If you frame it this way, they are doing exactly
what they should be doing in the end game.

The life force of an MMO is the player base. It leaves room for players to find
their own ways to have fun and get new players excited to be part of it.

The super neet hits end game and decides to makes the game feel alive... while
some people hit end game and ruin the game with gatekeeping and rent-seeking.

# the super neet filter - where are the super neets?

> Born to neet, forced to fit the norm

The world we created is hostile towards ordinary neets.

> \> go to school -> get a job -> buy a house -> ...

This is good, actually. 

> - \> learning things 
> - \> being employed in a salaried job
> - \> working well with your peers

"Doing things that normal people do" keeps you grounded in reality and you'll
be rewarded quite well for being a good participant in this system... but it's
the system that's trying to keep you in there forever.

Some people manage to catch an optimal trajectory from an early on and avoid
this trap... everyone else is headed straight for the normie basin.

This is the super neet filter.

# worth an attempt

The thing about pursuing neet life *later* on is that the path is not obvious
and things will get much worse before it can ever get better. Make it possible
to extend your timelines and keep exploring.

Many overstate the difficulty and underestimate the time it takes to get there.

We can still win the war on neets, there's a way out.

Become the neet in the shadows. Become the **employed neet**.
