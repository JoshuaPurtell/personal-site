## World Modeling Is Not Very Useful
As a researcher, I work with many people whose life's work it is to discover important truths. 
In startups, it's quite popular too. "What's one important truth you hold that few others do?" is the quote many know one of tech's finest investors by.
It is certainly valuable to understand how the world works - accurate rollouts are useful both in AI and IRL.

I strive to discover useful truths with my research, but I'm not sure I invest much time or energy doing so in business or otherwise.
Don't get me wrong. I strive to remedy gross confusion when I (often) find myself in its maw. But wielding hidden wisdom plumbed from the depths? It's never really paid off, to be honest.

I have friends who invest for a living, and see it play out similarly for them. They spend a lot of energy trying to think through a thesis, and it never really works out.
Eliminating lies and confusion, on the other hand, has paid off - big time.

## Lies Are Unnatural
The two are really the same thing - confusion is simply the entropic cloak a lie uses to conceal itself.

I might have a different model of the human mind than most. Many believe it to be animalistic, dumb, and inclined to fancy were it not for formal thought. 
In my experience, the mind naturally gravitates to reality, only departs from the truth when doing so is expedient.

Sometimes, the expediency is mediated by promise - we all know an investor or founder who demonstrated confused optimism vividly in 2021.
But much more often, the mind is cowed into accepting lies by powerful fear, guilt or shape. Those lies strangle their victims with unnatural, forced repression. 

## Lies Hurt

Repression here doesn't mean Freud, but a kind of physical contortion and grasping. The lie must be accepted else its victim be made *a bad person*, a threat that warps the body and mind of social animals like us.
It goes further - if one doesn't **spread** the lie, that also makes one *a bad person*. Repeatedly injuring others in this way, too, warps man.

With enough warping, man breaks. He might not snap in two - rarely this is the case - but he'll live in the shadow of the life he'd otherwise lead.
He'll live in an inverted world - good is bad, bad is good, everything is the same, action is painful, weakness is strength. Gross confusion will cause him to flail about in his affairs like a wounded animal. He will wail and gnash his teeth.

## Overcoming Dishonesty

This all might sound a bit melodramatic. I'm not a pessimist - I think that the will, when unshackled from lies, is capable of exceptional action and achievement as the rule, not the exception.
Liberation from lies and confusion is simple to achieve, and there are two quite consistent approaches I've seen work.

1. Fight the warping. Do meditation, yoga, exercise, massage, whatever it is to undo the warping / tanha wherever it's stored in the mind-body. If it sounds woo, it is, and it's not my speed but probably/definitely does happen.
2. Transvaluation. The warping is caused by fear, shame, and guilt. What if you were fine with being *bad*, *guilty*, and whichever other charged word liars throw at you? It takes a contrarian/disagreeable streak, but once you're over the hump, you're over the hump. Any further 'If you don't do X, you're *bad*!' formulae are hard not to sneer at. The great of those I know who are liberated from lies took this path.

## Life Without Lies

No one - especially not someone living in a society as addicted to lying as ours - can be completely free from lies and confusion. 
But, once liberated, things change. You trust your mind, body, intuition, and they trust you. 

You start making exceptionally good judgements, over and over, and exhibit simple, clear thinking by default. 
Once you've gotten into the strict habit of only speaking truthfully, your brain stops predicting expedient fiction and begins spending its compute on acting on and inferring from reality.

Every additional lie you excise, some fraction of your internal MCMC estimators get unhobbled. Every additional warping undone, another unit of compute free for planning and action in the world.

## Seek Obvious, not Hidden Truths

Because lies are so widespread, most of the important truths you're ignorant of are not hiding in an ancient Greek scroll, or to be found e.g. reasoning from the first principles of our ancestral environment, however entertaining that may be.
Most of them smack you in the face many times a day. Learning them comes naturally once you've purged the lies designed to prevent you from doing so.

I think I have a much better understanding of the world now than I did a few years ago. None of the delta is comprised of esoteric wisdom, and probably it would be rather disappointing to Thiel if he heard it enumerated, proposition by proposition.
But still, I regard that delta as a precious treasure, and intend to spend much effort growing it.
